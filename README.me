# Muzz Chat App

A clean architecture Android chat application built using Jetpack Compose and Room DB. This project was developed to complete the Muzz Android exercise and implements a fully offline, two-user messaging interface.

---

## Features

- Chat between two fixed users ("Mo Salah" and "Sarah")
- Fake replies for both users after sending a message
- Persistent message history using Room
- Smart grouping:
  - Timestamp divider if messages are more than 1 hour apart
  - Small spacing if the same user sends messages within 20s
- Crossfade animation when switching users
- Muzz-style theme and message bubbles using Material3
- Clean architecture: UI / ViewModel / Domain / Data layers

---

## Tech Stack

- **Jetpack Compose** (UI)
- **Kotlin Flow + StateFlow** (Reactive state management)
- **Room DB** (Offline persistence)
- **ViewModel** (State handling)
- **Material3** (Theme and components)

## Folder Structure

├── data/           # Room DB + repository
├── domain/         # Models and repository interface
├── ui/             # ViewModel, screens, composables

## Requirements Followed

- Message list & text entry
- Left/right aligned bubbles
- Timestamp headers (> 1hr apart)
- Message grouping logic (same sender, < 20s)
- Local-only chat logic with fake replies
- User toggle (Crossfade)
- Room-backed persistence
- Fully themed with Material3 and Muzz styling

---

## Improvements for Future

- Message search or filters
- Message editing/deleting
- Add a shimmer loading effect while messages load to enhance perceived performance
- Introduce per-message animations or bubble transitions using AnimatedContent
- Migrate from manual DI to Hilt for cleaner dependency injection and ViewModel provisioning
- Add unit tests for:
  - Timestamp section logic (isOverAnHour)
  - Message grouping logic (isWithin20Seconds, same sender)
- Improve UI accessibility (dynamic font size, color contrast adjustments)
